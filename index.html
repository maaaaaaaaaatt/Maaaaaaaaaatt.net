                Radio Station, Website<br>

                Listen<a href="https://no-soap.net" target="blank"> Here↩</a>
                <br><br>
                No Soap Radio is a modular, Part 15 AM radio station that treats broadcasting as both a
                design medium and a physical system. Operating at the scale of a few square kilometers rather than a
                city, the
                project explores how transmission, reception, and limitation shape meaning and communication. By working
                within the
                constraints of Part 15 AM—low power, short range, and susceptibility to noise—No Soap Radio foregrounds
                the
                material conditions of radio: antennas as design objects, static as texture, and proximity as an
                organizing principle. The station functions as a flexible platform for sound works, experimental
                programming, and teaching, emphasizing radio as an intimate, local form of publication and
                communication.
                <br><br>
                I designed and built a custom website for No Soap, Radio using
                Kirby CMS and developed a fully self-hosted backend platform using AzuraCast, all running on a Raspberry
                Pi 5 sitting on my desk.

                A simple gesture and meditation on the often delicate nature of websites, how links rot and don't come
                back, the dozens of browser tabs I have open at any given moment, and how computers are just rocks we
                taught to think.
                <br><br>
                100 Year Erosion is a website that's designed to slowly erode, turning the mountain to dust over 100
                years - but only as long as the page is live in your browser.

                (2024)<br>
                <br>
                In December 2024, I was invited to participate in the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thing.tube/"
                    target="blank">@thing.tube</a> NO-THING 24 hour livestream.
                <br><br>
                thing.tube is a peer-to-peer livestreaming platform and a form of software development as performance
                art. By decentralizing streaming through a variety of low- and high-tech interventions, the project
                offers an alternative to mainstream platforms like Twitch and YouTube, granting artists greater control
                over their work and its distribution. This approach fosters direct interaction between creators and
                visitors, without the mediation of conventional channels.
                <br><br>
                This livestream was organized around the theme of "nothing", so my contribution was to spend the day
                coding a website with the full text of Herman Melville's "Bartelby, the Scrivener", taking requests from
                the chat for CSS style tweaks.

                <br>
                These room-sized websites reimagine the web as a spatial, embodied experience. Each site is custom-coded
                and developed using a network of ESP-32 microcontrollers that create localized Wi-Fi access points using
                captive portals. An ESP-32's signal only reaches a few dozen feet from each board, encouraging the
                user's movement through
                the room and making proximity, orientation, and chance part of the browsing experience.
                <br><br>
                The work explores ideas of narrowcasting, access, and scale, asking the user to consider what a website
                becomes
                when it is temporary, offline, and inseparable from a physical environment. By designing, developing,
                and deploying both the hardware and software, I collapse distinctions between server, interface, and
                exhibition architecture.

                vols.design was a homepage for my GRDS 256 - Interaction Design classes at the University of
                Tennessee-Knoxville School of Design. One of my goals when rebuilding this class was to teach students
                how to build rich digital spaces and experiences with the simplest tools possible - in our instance,
                vanilla HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JS.
                <br><br>
                As a demonstration, I built vols.design using these same tools and principles. It offered a
                straightforward but powerful example that you don't need the latest (and often sluggish) front-end
                frameworks to design a website.

                Transmission//Reception was a special topics course I taught at UTK in Spring 2025. In this studio,
                students explored broadcasting through a variety of graphic forms, materials, and technologies. In
                particular, students programmed and operated a Part 15 AM radio station transmitting both within the Art
                + Architecture building and streaming online.
                <br><br>
                RADIO FREE GRDS was an experiment in collaborative broadcasting, transmitted from the <a
                    href="https://www.instagram.com/utkschoolofdesign/" target="_blank">@utkschoolofdesign</a>. The
                signal is comprised of 18
                individual stations, each with a unique programming strategy, aesthetic, and perspective.
                <br><br>
                Using the concept of broadcasting as a framework, students designed both physical (fliers, posters, and
                beyond) and invisible (radio broadcasts, sound design, and performance) media that engage with and
                complicate the act of communicating, while thinking critically about the importance of medium and
                message in their work. We researched and pulled inspiration from moments of intervention and subversion
                in public communication, with a special focus on underground, freeform, alternative, guerrilla, and
                pirate forms.

                I spent much of 2024 finding ways to avoid using Adobe Creative Cloud software (I optimistically called
                it "My Year of Alternative Tools") as both a protest against Adobe's increasingly pushy use of
                generative AI, but also as a way to think through my process as a designer and user. <em>Caesar's Palace
                    Jump</em> in particular is an experiment in finding a complicated workaround in order to make a
                simple book
                layout.

                Alternative tools workflow:<br>
                download video using semi-legal internet tools ➡️ extract frames using ffmpeg command line tool (I think
                the command was something like <code>ffmpeg -i knievel.mp4 -qscale:v 1
                    exported-frames/frame_%04d.png</code>) ➡️
                create the page layout using Finder and Keynote, adding page numbers and images ➡️ printing on the
                mailroom Xerox (don’t tell the IT department)

                I’m Feeling Lucky is an experiment in direct-to-consumer art.
                <br><br>
                A viewer purchases an original print through Paypal, which triggers a series of automated server
                processes - the code randomly selects an image from Google, applies a pre-made template (with my
                signature), and sends the file to be printed and shipped. The customer doesn’t know what print they’re
                buying until it arrives, and I never see what images ultimately are being sold with my signature
                attached (really, I don’t want to see it. Please don’t tag me
                [@matthewflores](https://www.instagram.com/matthewflores/) with any purchased prints with my name on
                them).

                Finder Jürgen is an experiment in alternative publishing that asks whether a book can be laid out and
                read within a Finder window.<br><br>
                Rather than a fixed sequence of pages, the publication exists as a live,
                ephemeral system: files, folders, and metadata become typographic and structural elements. The content
                continuously changes in response to how the user resizes, sorts, opens, and navigates the window, making
                interaction an integral part of reading. By treating the operating system interface as simultaneously a
                medium and
                a layout tool, the project reframes publishing as a dynamic, user-driven process rather than a static
                object.

                As part of <em>My Year of Alternative Tools</em>, I've been experimenting with Processing and p5.js to
                code graphics as a way of
                stepping outside commercial design software and returning to a more intuitive way of making.
                <br><br>
                Writing code to generate form forced me to think about process over polish, and how to embrace
                variability,
                constraint, and imperfection as design values. What happens when I focus on play and experiment rather
                than the dreaded "deliverable"?

                <br>
                Quick: what’s the maximum allowed dimensions of a PDF file? Any guesses? I’ll wait.
                <br><br>
                Answer: <a href="https://pdfa.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Max-Size-tweet-872x1024.png"
                    target="_blank">15 million inches by 15 million inches</a> or about 381 km2.
                <br><br>
                I thought this was a very funny but also very real limitation, so I looked for a reasonably funny image
                to display at its maximum size. I landed on an actual size PDF of the Cerne Abbas Giant, a (semi) famous
                example of pseudo-indigenous land art in Dorset, England.
                <br><br>
                Naturally, I had to print it out to test (again, please don’t tell the IT department I used a staff
                printer).

                Web Application<br>
                (2025)<br><br>
                I like to bridge between very digital and very analog ways of making in the studio - lately, this means
                designing flyers and print projects using a traditional paste-up layout technique.
                <br><br>
                A major pain point of this method is setting and resetting text and images in different sizes - so I put
                together a very quick and very rough helper to make it go a little faster and smoother.
                <br><br>
                Paste-Up Helper lets you add text/images, select your font (more coming soon!), choose some sizing
                options, and export to .PDF for printing and cutting and pasting! All built in a basic browser app with
                vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.
                <br><br>
                It's important to make your own tools, even if they're coarse and janky!

                As a radio enthusiast and someday Ham Radio Operator (I'm going to take the exam soon, I promise!), much
                of my time in the studio is finding ways to compare radio technology with visual design, and to see how
                each can tell us something about the nature of communication.
                <br><br>
                A particularly niche activity in the Ham world is EME Moonbounce, where you use the Moon itself as a
                giant reflector dish, bouncing your signal to the other side of the globe. I always wanted to go to the
                Moon, so I made a self-portrait, encoded it into a format for radio fax transmission (it sounds a little
                like dial-up), and recorded it to cassette for a future moon bounce transmission.

                <br>
                I designed this poster using Hellschreiber (a very antiquated protocol for radio) transmissions of
                Abbott and Costello's "Who's on First?"
                routine. I sent each line of the script to myself over shortwave radio, letting atmospheric noise and
                signal drift corrupt the text into visual static.<br><br>
                The Hellschreiber's mechanical printing method turns
                each miscommunication into literal marks on paper: garbled names, dropped words, and interference
                patterns that mirror the confusion in the original sketch. The poster uses these transmission artifacts
                as their primary typography, where "What" becomes visual noise and "I Don't Know" disintegrates into
                pixel scatter. Static isn't a bug here but the actual design language, making the medium perform the
                same breakdowns as the comedy routine it carries.

                <br>
                During my solo show, You're the Man Now, Dog, at Cleo in Savannah, Georgia, I would send daily fax
                transmissions at a fixed time, building an installation piece
                by piece over the exhibition's run. I installed clipboards to hold the daily print, creating a growing
                archive of thermal paper artifacts.
                <br><br>
                The
                work operates on multiple temporalities: the slow accumulation of the installation itself, the brief
                mechanical event of each transmission, and the chance encounter of being present when the fax machine
                activates. Visitors who showed up at the right moment witnessed the performance aspect, while others saw
                only its residue. <br><br>
                I'm very interested in fax technology's particular qualities (its line-by-line rendering,
                relative slowness, and transmission errors), and this is an attempt to reclaim the weridness of fax as
                both medium and subject, turning the obsolescence of
                telecommunication hardware into a gallery event that unfolds whether anyone's watching or not.

                Jokes are a terribly intimate form of communication, even if we tend to resist thinking of them in that
                way. These Funny Fones used to exist more firmly in the context of how we communicate with each other on
                a daily basis - maybe you remember seeing one in an arcade, or a bowling alley, or at the end of a bank
                of payphone.
                <br><br>
                I repurposed an original Funny Fone and filled it with custom electronics (Arduino, mostly) and code so
                that instead of playing you a joke, when you pay a quarter it plays an audio telling of Richard
                Brautigan’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9LzKGQS2w8" target="_blank">“I Was Trying to
                    Describe You to Someone.”</a> The catch: some of the recordings are performed
                by a human, others by an AI deepfake.
                Each playback asks whether the voice delivering these
                lines changes their meaning, whether intimacy survives algorithmic speech, and what happens when you try
                to make something as private as describing someone you care about a transaction.

                <br>
                As a UX/UI Designer and Front-End Developer at Georgia Public Broadcasting, I led the effort to rethink
                and redesign the organization’s digital presence across web and mobile platforms. Working within a
                public media context, I focused on clarity, accessibility, and editorial structure, ensuring that our
                news,
                education, and cultural programming verticals were easy to discover and engaging to navigate. I
                collaborated
                closely with the newsroom, engineering, and product teams to translate a complex content ecosystem into
                coherent user experiences, balancing the needs of diverse audiences with the constraints of legacy
                systems and public media standards.
                <br><br>
                I spearheaded a complete redesign of GPB’s Drupal-based website and companion app, designing and
                developing user-facing
                systems that were flexible, scalable, and responsive across devices. This included establishing design
                patterns, refining navigation and information architecture, and implementing component-based interfaces
                that could support ongoing growth. By aligning visual design, UX strategy, and front-end development,
                the redesign modernized GPB’s digital identity while improving performance, usability, and long-term
                maintainability.

                (2019-2023)<br>
                <br>
                As a Designer for GPB Education, I focused on creating engaging, age-appropriate digital experiences for
                K–5 students across the state of Georgia. My work centered on the design of a suite of educational games
                and interactive software that aligned with state curriculum standards while remaining playful,
                intuitive, and accessible for young learners. I collaborated with educators, curriculum specialists, and
                developers to translate learning objectives into clear visual systems, interaction patterns, and game
                mechanics that supported exploration and discovery.
                <br><br>
                Across these projects, I emphasized usability and inclusivity—designing interfaces that
                could be easily understood by early readers, accommodate a wide range of abilities, and perform reliably
                in classroom environments with varying levels of technology access. I developed visual systems, UI
                components, and interaction flows that balanced fun with instructional clarity, ensuring that the
                games functioned as both an educational tool and an inviting entry point to digital learning. This
                work contributed to a statewide platform that supported teachers, engaged students, and extended public
                education through thoughtfully designed interactive media.

                Description:
                For this assignment you will create an app from the content of ten linked Wikipedia entries. Everyone
                will start from the same place: the Wikipedia entry for Interaction Design. From within this entry you
                will choose a word or phrase which is hyperlinked to another Wikipedia entry, and collect the main
                column text for that term. From this second term you will choose another hyperlinked term, and so on,
                for 10 terms. (As an example, I collected the following string: interaction design, Muriel Cooper,
                SX-70, Mylar, sailboat, paddle, yacht, etc.)
                <br><br>
                The link chain you create will guide the user flow in your app design. Starting from a splash page, you
                will design an experience that takes a user from the start through the end of your chain. Consider user
                flow, navigation standards, and the constraints of the mobile device in your design.<br><br>
                Objectives:<br>
                → Create a working prototype of a mobile app, fore fronting user flow and linked
                content.<br>
                → Consider narrative structures as generative structures.<br>

                For your final project, you will develop an hour-long radio broadcast alongside a 16+ page printed zine.
                This project will help us think about how radio can function as a form of publication, and consider the
                relationship between sound and print.
                <br><br>
                The challenge is to create a meaningful connection between the broadcast and the zine—bridging the gap
                between audio and visual storytelling.

                The Atomic Design framework is a strategy for crafting robust design
                systems in a methodical, flexible, modular way. You may be asking: what’s a
                design system? In a nutshell, a design system is a collection of reusable
                components that can be built together to create any digital product.
                There are many different ways to approach the creation of a design system.
                Atomic Design is one of the methodologies for organizing a design system
                that helps make the life of designers and developers easier and their
                workflows much more efficient.
                <br><br>
                In this project, we will be learning the workflow of creating a design system
                from the ground up using the Atomic Design method. We will also be
                identifying and classifying some essential UI elements, and exploring how
                they can be utilized in deliberate ways in order to define the structure, flow,
                and look of a digital product.
                <br><br>
                Objectives:<br>
                → Using the Atomic Design framework, create a design system of unique and discrete elements that can be
                combined into deliverable products.<br>

                GRDS 103 - Graphic Design Foundations Studio III<br>
                UTK School of Design<br>
                <br>
                Movement to a Movement is a motion design project in which students choose a song and are assigned an
                art or design movement (such as Bauhaus, Futurism,
                Dada, Surrealism, Constructivism, or Minimalism) to reinterpret as a short animated music video. Through
                research and formal analysis, students identify the visual language, conceptual frameworks, and
                historical context of their assigned movement and abstract those qualities into motion, typography,
                color, rhythm, and pacing.
                <br><br>
                Rather than focusing on narrative, the project emphasizes sound-driven visual systems and formal
                experimentation. Students synchronize animation to audio and explore how time, movement, and repetition
                can function as core design elements. The project introduces industry-standard motion design workflows
                and positions animation as an extension of graphic design practice.

                Web accessibility is a critical aspect of web design and development,
                focusing on making websites functional for any given user. This concept is
                rooted in the belief that everyone, regardless of their physical or cognitive
                abilities, should have equal access to information and services available on
                the internet. Accessibility is not just a legal requirement but an ethical
                imperative. By making accessible websites, designers and developers can
                reach a broader audience and make the online world a more inclusive
                space.
                <br><br>
                In this project, we will examine what makes a website accessible, and
                (maybe more importantly), what makes a website inaccessible to certain
                users. We will learn current accessibility standards, what they mean, and
                how they can be applied to a design that is empathetic and plans for
                differences between individuals.

                Objectives:<br>
                → Use sitemaps to guide website navigation design.<br>
                → Define user personas through UX research.<br>
                → Consider accessibility as a core component to a website design.<br>
