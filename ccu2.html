            <br><br>
            If you are reading this, then you must be on the search committee for the Assistant Professor of Graphic Design position in the Department of Visual Arts at Coastal Carolina University (whew!). Welcome to my portfolio!
            I appreciate you taking the time to look at some of the things I’ve made.
        
        <br><br>
        I hope you enjoy my work - my mother certainly does.

         <p>Digital Video Loop, dimensions variable</p><br />
         <p class="description">This three-channel video installation is an homage to a classic Ringling Brothers
            performance by clown Emmett Kelly. I wanted to stretch away from Kelly, to complicate his story, and to keep
            myself, (or the character of myself, at least), from ever finding the same resolution Emmett finds. I gave
            myself a doomed task - an endless performance of trying to sweep up a spotlight. The loop here is important,
            because it lays bare the mechanics of how a joke operates, and gives the viewer space to consider their role
            in the mechanism. We both end up entangled in the setup, looking for resolution beyond a punchline.</p>

         <p class="description">Increasingly, I’m attempting to transition my design practice away from a standard set of tools (by this I mostly mean Adobe Creative Cloud)

            This was created using a command line interface to split an image, and composed using Finder.</p>

         <p class="description">I started with a basic premise: what would art for dogs look like? I quickly discovered
            that dogs are for the most part terribly short sighted and mostly colorblind, so I resorted to a guaranteed
            winner: squeaky toy sounds and positive reinforcement.<br /><br />

            On the left, I hired two actresses (who might actually be one woman in a wig) to repeat the mantra “who’s a
            good boy?” - on the right, I performed a rendition of Elvis’s classic “Hound Dog” on a squeaky steak. I then
            installed the videos at dog height.</p>

         <p>Octopus Ink on Raw Canvas, 36" x 52" each</p><br />
         <p class="description">A boxer needs to be an expert in misdirection in order to survive, because as soon as he
            gets figured out, he gets knocked out. An octopus does the same with its color changing and by spraying ink.
            <br /> <br />
            How do you tell the joke you won’t tell, or show the thing you won’t reveal? Joke-telling is a survival
            technique, a defense mechanism, as much as camouflage. This nexus is the inspiration for Special Boy (All
            Natural), self-portraits printed in octopus ink on stretched canvas.
            <br /> <br />
            When using yourself as subject and object, you’re always going to bump into the limits of that choice. This
            piece is my thinking through how an activity as revealing as using yourself as subject and object can
            obscure as well. </p>

         <p class="description">For this piece, I used AI machine learning to algorithmically generate a script for a
            stand-up comedy performance from a base library of famous acts, including Richard Pryor, Andy Kaufman, Joan
            Rivers, and George Carlin. I then hired a voice actor (on the internet, natch) to perform the act, which is
            recorded and presented through a disembodied speaker on a microphone stand.<br /><br />

            Through these steps of translation, we get further and further from the actual, embodied performances in the
            original, and toward something that features the rhythms and
            conventions of stand-up, but becomes less and less human in the execution.</p>
